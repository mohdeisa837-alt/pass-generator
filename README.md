# Neon Password Awareness Generator

This project is a **single‑file web app** that helps demonstrate how attackers can guess weak passwords based on common personal details. It is **for educational purposes only** and aims to raise awareness about the importance of creating strong, unique passwords.

## Features

* Neon dark aesthetic theme (HTML, CSS, JavaScript in a single file).
* Collects user details like name, DOB, city, phone, etc.
* Generates **50 likely‑to‑be‑guessed passwords** using only alphanumeric characters.
* Shows results in a styled list.
* Options to **copy** or **download** the generated passwords as `pass.txt`.
* Responsive layout, works on desktop and mobile.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in any modern web browser.
2. Fill in personal details (first name, last name, nickname, DOB, city, phone, pet name, favourite color, team, lucky number).
3. Click **Generate 50 Passwords**.
4. A list of 50 guessable password combinations will be displayed.
5. You can:

   * Copy the list to clipboard.
   * Download the list as `pass.txt`.

## Example Generated Passwords

* `eisa2002`
* `khan786`
* `mumbai123`
* `sheru07`
* `iloveyou2024`

*(Generated list varies based on user input.)*

## Educational Note ⚠️

This tool demonstrates why personal details (like your birthday, nickname, city, or pet’s name) should **never** be part of your password. Attackers often use such details to guess passwords quickly.

### Good Practices

* Use **16+ character passwords**.
* Avoid dictionary words or personal info.
* Prefer **randomly generated passwords** from a password manager.
* Use **unique passwords** for each site/app.

This project is open‑source and free to use for **learning and awareness** purposes. Do not use it for malicious activities.
